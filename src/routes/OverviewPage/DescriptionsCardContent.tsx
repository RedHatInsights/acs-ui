        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud Service is the pioneering
        Kubernetes-native security platform, equipping organizations to more
        securely build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications anywhere. The
        solution helps improve the security of the application build process,
        protect the application platform and configurations, and detect and
        respond to runtime issues. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud
        Service lowers operational costs by reducing the learning curve for
        implementing Kubernetes security, provides built-in controls for
        enforcement to reduce operational risk, and uses a Kubernetes-native
        approach that supports built-in security across the entire software
        development life cycle, facilitating greater developer productivity.
